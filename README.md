# Introduction to Statistics and EEG Analysis
R stats and EEG analysis theory components of my "intro to stats EEG" course. Targeted at complete beginners to the RStudio environment. No assumed knowledge required.

The "lectures" folder contains some basic theory about statistical testing and EEG analysis.

The "data" folder contains two basic datasets that the R tutorials use.

The "R_Tutorials" folder contains R Markdown files that step through basic statistical analyses and visualisation. Some have answers included, others contain only the scenario and instructions.
